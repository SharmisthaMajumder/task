Hello!
Here I shall keep my main program files

Thank You. 
TIPS for GITHUB:

In Git, if you wish to merge two files into a single one (Say, they are under two different branches), 
then simply apply Pull request

In Git, if you wish to contribute in someone else's work, then use Fork. And use Pull command then.
